================
  Installation
================

  Copy the full BASE directory to your system (or use directly on the
  network computer--either works)

================
  Usage
================

  Place your input file (either .xls or .xlsx, the program can understand either)
  in the Input folder, which should be empty. After that, navigate back to the base
  folder and run convert.exe, which will output the newly created INTLStatusReport
  to the Output folder.

  As a warning: This will replace the previously generated status report with a new
  file, so if you would like to save the previous report, move it elsewhere before
  running the program.

================
  Source Code
================

  You can view the source code in the Source Code folder. Manipulating this will
  have no effect on the executable, so if you want to poke around and change some
  things there, feel free to.
