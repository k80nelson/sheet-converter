Sheet Converter

  Version: 2.5

================
  Installation
================

  Copy the full BASE directory (Converter 2.0) to your system (or use directly on the
  network computer--either works)

================
  Usage
================

  Place your input file (either .xls or .xlsx, the program can understand either)
  in the Input folder, which should be empty. After that, run convert.exe, which 
  will output the newly created INTLStatusReport.xlsx to the Output folder.

  As a warning: This will replace the previously generated status report with a new
  file, so if you would like to save the previous report, move it elsewhere before
  running the program.

================
  Source Code
================

  You can view the source code in the Source Code folder under Converter 2,0. 
  Manipulating this will have no effect on the executable, so if you want to poke 
  around and change some things there, feel free to.
